## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`demos/`](./demos/) | Fully encapsulated, end-to-end examples that showcase Zerobus Ingest in action. Each demo highlights a particular pattern or industry use case and includes everything needed to deploy and run independently. |
| [`example_clients/`](./example_clients/) | Reusable reference implementations of Zerobus Ingest clients. Each example client demonstrates how to connect a specific protocol or data source to Zerobus, providing a foundation users can take and build upon. |

# Zerobus Ingest Examples


Welcome to the world of streamlined ingestion!
In this repo, you will find examples and demos of Zerobus Ingest, a push-based API that streamlines streaming ingestion into the Lakehouse.

* Learn more [here](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/zerobus-overview)
* This repository is not for Zerobus Ingest SDKs, view the SDKs [here](https://github.com/databricks/zerobus-sdk)

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`demos/`](./demos/) | Fully encapsulated, end-to-end examples that showcase Zerobus Ingest in action. Each demo highlights a particular pattern or industry use case and includes everything needed to deploy and run independently. |
| [`example_clients/`](./example_clients/) | Reusable reference implementations of Zerobus Ingest clients. Each example client demonstrates how to connect a specific protocol or data source to Zerobus, providing a foundation users can take and build upon. |

## Demos
* [Data Drifter Regatta](./demos/data_drifter/) - Real-time sailboat race tracking with marine telemetry (SDK/gRPC + REST API)

## Example Clients
* [Salesforce Zerobus](./example_clients/salesforce_zerobus/) - Stream Salesforce CDC events to Delta tables via the Pub/Sub API (Python & Go)
* [GitHub Zerobus SDP OCSF](./example_clients/github_zerobus_sdp_ocsf/) - Push GitHub public events via Zerobus + SDP integration following Cyber Lakehouse OCSF Medallion Architecture blueprint
* [syslog-ng Zerobus](./example_clients/syslog-ng-zerobus/) - Forward syslog-ng log streams to a Delta table via OTLP/gRPC with automatic OAuth2 token management.
